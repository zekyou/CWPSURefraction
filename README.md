# CWPSURefraction
There are some program helping you to change files from sg2 to sgy. And some examples are presented.
## Description
Firstly, there are two types of files. The first one is .exe which can help you change files from sg2 to sgy by typing
```powershell
./seg2segy filename.sg2 1
```
Or your sg2 files may not be suitable for this program. Then you can use the second program named 'seg2fix' to fix your sg2 files by typing
``` powershell
./seg2fix filename.sg2
```
Secondly, there are four example data which are detected by me. Maybe you can use this files to complete your homework such as Using CWPSU To Plot a Refraction curve.
That's all. Thanks!
